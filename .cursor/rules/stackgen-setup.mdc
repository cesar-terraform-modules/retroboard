- Use the stackgen project named "cesar-demo" in StackGen for all services and infrastructure changes in this project. The UUID of the project is 7dc8215c-198d-4fca-a3a2-9a02ce51077a
- When using StackGen for creating new services make sure to use the "SNS Fanout" as the default resource pack for each new microservice.
- When doing pull requests for infrastructure changes:
    - Use "StackGen" to generate the infrastructure changes
    - Any infrastructure pull requests should be opened using the push to git capability of StackGen against the "main" branch of the [retroboard](https://github.com/cesar-terraform-modules/retroboard) repository and in a directory called `/infrastructure`. If possible, reuse the GitHub configuration called "retroboard-demo", otherwise create a new one.
