- Use the stackgen project named "retroboard" in StackGen for all services and infrastructure changes in this project. The UUID of the project is 60ff09a4-2c58-40a5-a466-d82ac21ec5d7
- When using StackGen for creating new services make sure to use the "SNS Fanout" as the default resource pack for each new microservice.
- When doing pull requests for infrastructure changes:
    - Use "StackGen" to generate the infrastructure changes
    - Any infrastructure pull requests should be opened using the push to git capability of StackGen against the "main" branch of the [retroboard](https://github.com/cesar-terraform-modules/retroboard) repository and in a directory called `/infrastructure`. If possible, reuse the GitHub configuration called "cesar-git-configuration", otherwise create a new one.
